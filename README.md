# Naver Cafe Cleaner

Got too many cafes of which you don't want to be a part anymore? Sick of joining random cafes just to see the full search result? You might want to leave 'em all, but Naver just don't seem to care! (Yes, they *want* you to stay in all those cafes.) 

Worry no more, my friends! **Naver Cafe Cleaner** is here to help! This does not store your sensitive information, and if you are still doubtful, just run this on your local machine yourself!

This utilizes [python-naverlogin](https://github.com/hallazzang/python-naverlogin) by hallazzang to send requests to Naver as a logged in user, and Flask to provide a dead-simple web UI.

Python > 3.6 is required.
